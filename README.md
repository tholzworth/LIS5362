<h1> Tea Time With Tia</h1>
<h2> Part TWO </h2>

<strong> Welcome to my world of Travel  </strong>

<em> A little something about me...</em>
<p> Hello! My name is Tia Holzworth, I'm a former Army soldier turned US contractor living in the Middle East and I love to travel for fun! I'm twenty-seven years old, I graduated from Florida State University as an undergrad and now I'm attending FSU for my Masters! I have a blog where I write about life and travel tips for those who are interested. In the last year, I've traveled to Sri Lanka, India, Spain, Dubai, Bahrain and the United States!  </p>
<p> The goal of this website is to provide something that will give you all a little more incite on travel outside of my normal blog posts about my top things to do in each place. On my main blog website, I blog more about what I would do but this one is to help you plan your perfect trip outside of reading my blogs. Here, you can tell me where you'd like to go and I will put together an entire itinerary with prices, hotels, and excursions plus a small fee to myself for creating your dream vacation. </p>

appears



when you																				view
it
as a regular 

webpage, vs how it looks
